## Teaching Assistant (TA)

No teaching assistant.

## Course Overview

In this independent study, we will undertake an object-oriented development project.
The goal will be to build a significant real-world system using Java.
In particular, we will develop a learning management system (LMS),
which will assist instructors with a broad spectrum of class-management activities,
such as emailing students, computing grades, and administering polls/quizzes.
At the end of the course, the goal will be to release the code
publicly with an open-source license.

## Prerequisites

There are **no formal prerequisites**, although you should have some basic
computer science background and experience with computer programming.

## Online Community and Communication

We will use [LoboGit](https://lobogit.unm.edu/) to host the project repository,
and will use functionality such as README.md (markdown) files and comments to
document/discuss individual functionality.

## Textbook and Other Reading Materials

No textbook is required. We will use the [Java Docs](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/)
and other tool documentation as necessary.

## Grading

The following percentages show how final grades will be calculated. 

| **item**         | **percentage** |
| -----------------|----------------|
| Java project     | 70%            |
| final report     | 20%            |
| participation    | 10%            |

Letter grades will be calculated as follows:
59 and below is an F,
60-62 is a D-,
63-66 is a D,
67-69 is a D+,
70-72 is a C-,
73-76 is a C,
77-79 is a C+,
80-82 is a B-,
83-86 is a B,
87-89 is a B+,
90-92 is an A-,
93-98 is an A,
and 99-100 is an A+.

NOTE: The goal of this course is to build a useful product, and to learn more about
object-oriented programming, NOT to stress about grades. Good work on the project,
good communication about progress, and a well-written final report will be rewarded
with a good grade.

## Collaboration

We will use Git for version control and collaboration.

## Respectfulness and Academic Honesty

I expect every student to show respect to me and fellow students. This course is preparation
for your future career, so make sure you are behaving with the same level of professionalism that
would be expected at a future full-time position. My general rule of thumb is:
**_informal_ is okay, but _disrespectful_ is not**.

- I prefer to be addressed by my first name ("Jedidiah"), but "Dr. McClurg" is also fine.
- It is vital that you do your best to communicate with me throughout the project, and attend project meetings.

Plagiarism/cheating is NOT acceptable, and will be met with quick and harsh penalties.
I do not want to see any academic dishonesty in this class!

## Accommodation

In accordance with University Policy 2310 and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), academic
accommodations may be made for any student who notifies me (the instructor) of the need for an accommodation.
It is imperative that you take the initiative to bring such needs to my attention, as I am not legally
permitted to inquire. Students who may require assistance in emergency evacuations should contact me
as to the most appropriate procedures to follow. Contact Accessibility Resource Center at 277-3506
for additional information"

## Tentative Schedule

We will keep the schedule relatively flexible.

## Tentative Lab Topics

1. TODO

## Computing Resources

You will need access to a Linux machine.
I would strongly recommend using Ubuntu Linux.

There is a computer lab in the Farris Engineering Center (FEC 2065), which should
be accessible to students. You will need a proximity-enabled student ID card to
open the door (you can check whether you have such a card by looking for a 5-digit
number on the back, below the magnetic strip). If you want access added to your
proximity-enabled card, please ask at the front desk in the main CS office
(FEC 2200).

You can access a random machine in the FEC computer lab via SSH:

```
ssh moons.cs.unm.edu
```

You can also access the machines in the CS basement lab (B146A Centennial Engineering Center)
by using SSH:

```
ssh b146-xx.cs.unm.edu
```

(where xx goes from 01 to 76).

Additionally, you can access a random virtual machine run by the CS department:

```
ssh trucks.cs.unm.edu
```

Another alternative is to set up your own Linux machine. The easiest way to
do this is to install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/). You can install
this on Windows/MAC/Linux. Then, download an [Ubuntu Linux disk image](https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop),
create a new virtual machine (VM) within VirtualBox, and boot your VM using
the disk image.
